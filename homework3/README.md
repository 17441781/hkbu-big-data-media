## Data Analysis
* `titles` - use word cloud to analyse what people care about most
* `speakers` - use line chart to calculate who come to TED often
* `hashtags` - use bar to represent what are the tags people like most
* `views` - combine the 'views' with 'titles' and 'hashtags', we could find something in common

* There are so many modules and visulization tools on the internet, yet some are difficult to internalize
* The previous codes is not stable to scrape the data
* Thanks for those examples on the course outline and D&NS
